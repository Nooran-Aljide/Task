- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
A z-score gives us an idea of how far from the mean a data point is, its calculated using the formula [z = (x – μ) / σ] 
In Min max Scaling for every data point, the minimum value of that pint is transformed into a 0, the maximum value is transformed into a 1, and every other value gets transformed into a decimal between 0 and 1, its calculated using the formula [z= (x - min)/(max - min)] 
Normalizing data is an essential part in many fields such as machine learning (for example many applications seeks to compare data points to find out some patterns), the most important part of data normalization is better analysis leading to growth.

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library?
  what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
Junit5 is a version of Junit which is a unit testing open-source framework for the Java programming language. it can be used to write and execute automated tests. we can use it to find bugs early in the development phase, which increases the code’s reliability.
Unit testing aims to test each part of the application (such as methods and classes) separately before integrating all the units together, it makes the debugging process of the code easier and ensures that all code meets quality standards before it’s deployed.

- What is the IDE did you use?
```
intelliJ IDE
```
- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
I didn't use
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
The given time is not appropriate for persons who are working in other jobs 
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how:
```
yes, this task allows me to use the intelliJ IDE for the first time, 
it also gave me the chance to read about new topics such as:
1. the importance of using built tools such as Maven 
2. the importance of unit testing 
```
